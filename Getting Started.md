## Getting Things Setup & Updates

</p>

 **Note: This update process takes about 1-2 hours.**


  1.  Open the Start menu, select "Settings" and then "Windows Update". Say check for updates and let this download and install everything in the list (you might have to click "Download and Install" to trigger this. This might take awhile but once everything is completed click the "restart now" button. Do not click this until everything is completed or you could run into issues. **Note:**If you see a update that wouldn't install, and even when clicking "Retry" it could not install. If you see this don't worry this will be fixed in step 5.

  2.  After it restarts, go back to the Start menu, then settings, then Windows Update again. Say check for updates and wait to see if there are any more. If there is a "Windows Preview" type update you can click the button to download and install or leave it, I did install the latest. If you had more updates in this step, when they are all completed restart your device.

  3. After it restarts, open the Xbox App and click the **"Install Now"** link where it says it needs an update. Once it completes the Xbox app will close and reopen. When that happens, open the Microsoft Store again and go to **"My Apps" and "Get Updates"** - it will now grab even more updates so just let it download and install all. Once this is done restart your device.

  4. You'e almost done! Once the device restarts open your start menu and in the search box field tap there and type "Disk Cleanup" and open it. Once it loads, click the button for "Clean Up System Files" and it will close and reopen. Click the checkbox next to every option (you have to sc5oll down to get them all" then click "Clean up". This got me back almost 15gigs on the hard drive.

  6. After that, go the the start menu and in the search box type "Defrag" and open the Disk defrag app. When it loads, click your "C:" drive and click "Optimize".
  
  7.  Check if your time is off (bottom right corner of the Windows menu bar) - Right click (Right Trigger if you are using the built in controller) on the date/time in the bottom right corner, select **"Adjust Date/Time"**. Check to make sure the toggle is **ON for Set Time Automatically** , **ON for Adjust for Daylight Savings Automatically**, Make sure your timezone is correct in the drop down for Timezone, and OFF for set timezone automatically. Then click the button for **"Sync Now"** under additional settings and that should set your day/time correctly. **Note: Step 9 Fixes the issue with Xbox Game Pass not working properly.** 
  
  **That's it everything is up-to-date for your Lenovo Legion Go device.**

### Setting up Game Pass for Offline use

 * **Note:** Most games with a campaign mode will be playable offline, but games with network co-op or multiplayer features will not work while you’re offline. Before you go offline, connect to the Xbox network to sync your most recent game save to the cloud. While you play offline, your game save progress will continue to be saved locally, and it’ll sync the next time you sign in to Xbox. If you want to continue playing on a different device, you’ll need to go online and connect to the Xbox network to allow your local saved game to sync with the cloud again.

 * **Note 2:** PC Game Pass game licenses expire after 30 days when playing offline, and licenses for owned games expire after 14 days. To keep playing your game offline, go back online and launch the game. This renews the game’s license on your device and ensures you can go back to playing offline.  

You can only have one device as your designated offline device. **To set your device as your designated offline device:**

  * Make sure that you’re online.
  * Check that your device has the latest Windows updates: **Go to Start -> Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update and see if any relevant updates are available**.
  * Open the Microsoft Store. You’ll be prompted to sign in if you haven’t already.
  * Select your profile icon in the upper right corner.
  * Select App settings, and then under Offline permissions, make sure that the toggle is set to On.

Once you set this, any devices previously designated as offline will be toggled to Off, and you’ll no longer be able to play games offline on those devices.

**Prepare your game or games**

Once your device is set up, you’ll need to launch each game you want to play offline while signed in to the Xbox network. You only need to do this once per game, and you’ll need to do this even if you’ve already launched the game on your device.

  * Make sure that you’re online, and that your device is set as your designated offline device. (See the steps above for details on how to do this.)
  * Launch the game you want to play offline. When prompted, sign in to Xbox.
  * Once you’ve started playing the game, you can exit at any time.

Repeat this process for each game you want to play offline. Once completed, you can go offline at any time and launch those games whenever you want to play them, without needing to sign in online each time.
